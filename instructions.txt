Hi! This exercise will help you reinforce your git and terminal skills. 


Clone this repo into your a* folder by:
- navigate to your desktop then a-star folder
- once in the folder, use pwd to make sure you are in the right place
- run git clone `url` and replace `url` with this repo's link


Once you have the repo set up on your local computer:
- add a file in the terminal using touch (yourname).txt, add whatever you want in the file and then 
- git add .
- git commit -m "this is my first commit"
- git push
